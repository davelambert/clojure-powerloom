This is Clojure-PowerLoom, a Clojure wrapper for the Java version of
the PowerLoom knowledge representation and reasoning system.

There are two APIs:

    powerloom.low: Replicates the Common Lisp STELLA API as much as
    		   possible.  This level works in terms of objects
    		   from the STELLA/PowerLoom system.

    powerloom.high: A more Clojureish interface that tries to hide
      		    the STELLA/PowerLoom Java objects.

Take a look at the INSTALL file for instructions on how to install
Clojure-PowerLoom, and the test suite to see how it works.  This code
is at a very early stage, and interfaces will change as coverage of
the PowerLoom API increases.
