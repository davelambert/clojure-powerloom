Installing Clojure-PowerLoom

You will need to download and install the PowerLoom JARs manually,
since they seem not to be available through any Maven or similar
repositories.  Clojure-PowerLoom is developed against the development
snapshots of PowerLoom 4, and in particular has been tested with
version 4.0.2.beta.  Tarballs of various versions are available from:

    http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/PowerLoom/download.html

You need to put the powerloom.jar and stella.jar files in the
classpath.  If you've unzipped a PowerLoom tarball to $POWERLOOM, the
following should give you a working Clojure-PowerLoom environment:

    $ git clone https://github.com/davelambert/clojure-powerloom.git
    $ cd clojure-powerloom
    $ lein deps
    $ cp $POWERLOOM/native/java/lib/*jar lib
    $ lein test
